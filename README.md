# .vimfiles
A collection of files for customizing my Vim environment.

All plugins for vim7 are managed by [Pathogen][pathogen] by Tim Pope and the
native package manager is used for vim8. Upgrade and installation instructions
are detailed below.

## Installation
To install this `.vimrc`, clone the repository to `~/.vim`. Pass the
recursive flag to ensure that all submodules are cloned as well. Finally,
create a symlink to the `.vimrc` to make it available to Vim on startup.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/PhiloEpisteme/.vim ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

## Plugins

Some plugins only work properly with a specific version of vim. All plugins
which are supported by both vim7 and vim8 belong in the
`pack/my-packages/start/` directory. Plugins which only work with vim7 belong
in the `bundle/` directory. Packages which only work with vim8 should go in
`pack/my-packages/start/` directory and have their plugin name added to the
`pathogen_blacklist` found in `.vim7.vimrc`.
